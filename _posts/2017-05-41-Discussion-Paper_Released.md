Compute Canada, in all its incarnations, is now ten years old; this
milestone represents an opportunity for the research community that
requires computation and data to reflect on what it wants a
computational research support organization to do, and how best it
should work.

We're pleased today to release a discussion paper to the community
to contribute to that conversation. "Compute Canadian: Building a
successful and federated computational research enterprise, together",
proposes that any computational research support organization in
Canada should serve Canadian research in a researcher-centred,
service-oriented, and truly national way; and that it should operate
as a true federation of equal partners, interoperable but not
identical, collaborative and modern.

The discussion paper then examines other federations, in Canada and
across the world, to consider best practices for their governance
and operation, and to apply them to the principles proposed.

We hope that this paper will be part of a much larger conversation
including voices from across the entire research and scholarship
community, and all of those that support them in their computational
research efforts.
