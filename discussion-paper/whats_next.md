What’s Next
===========

Our shared national project of enabling Canadian research with a country-wide portfolio of resources and expertise is too important to do poorly; and it is too important for us to retreat back into silos, limiting researchers to those experts and systems that happen to be nearby.

After having read this document, you likely have something to say. Hopefully there were parts of this proposal that you strongly agree with; even better, there are probably parts you disagree with, think are missing, or think should go missing.

The purpose of this document is not to advocate in particular for the proposals contained within (although the proposals made here reflect genuinely-held convictions, rather than being straw-man arguments). The purpose is to start in earnest a conversation that should have been launched officially three years ago, allowing the community and stakeholders to come to a consensus about what the internal organizational structure of Compute Canada should be, how it should make decisions, and how it should offer services to Canadian researchers and scholars.

The most important next step, then, is for you to have this discussion with colleagues locally and across the country, disagreeing vehemently initially on some points, and coming to agreement on others. We have put together one forum to have such discussions at <https://www.rebootcompute.ca>, where we would also be delighted to host competing proposals, but the location of the discussions doesn’t matter; that they take place does.

The members and regions can rebuild a Compute Canada that works, and works the way the community wants it to, but they cannot do so without before the community tells them what destination they should aim for. As the title of this document suggests, getting there from here will require completely turning off Compute Canada before starting it up again, with a completely new board and staff that are completely committed to the model and priorities that the community have chosen. But this process can happen in months, not years, and the result will be a Canadian research community served by a successful, truly federal, national computational research support organization. The Canadian research and research computing communities can do great things together. Let’s get started.
