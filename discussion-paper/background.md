Background
==========

Compute Canada has failed. We need the next one to succeed.

Compute Canada --- the national project --- was assembled to drastically improve the capabilities of Canadian research. Investigators were too often limited in the scholarship they could perform because of lack of local research computing expertise, or availability of storage or computational resources. The solution to this problem was clear then, and is still clear now. The most scarce and valuable of our resources, the expertise of research computing staff, actually grows, rather than is diminished, by applying it to many diverse problems; and economies of scale apply to computational and storage resources, which can be efficiently shared. Thus, the best way to support Canadian research is to pool resources nationally, rather than building many small silos. The federal government agreed, providing a steady stream of federal operating funding well above what similar organizations have available elsewhere, freeing us from relying solely on institutions or even provinces.

But at this point it is clear that Compute Canada — the actual existing organization — has failed. Rather than building on the strengths of the regional organizations and the national perspective of a central group, the existing structure has radically worsened the natural tensions and distrust between them, escalating into a spiralling cycle of control and dismissive centralization on one side, and increasing disengagement and resistance on the other.

We thus find ourselves in a situation where Compute Canada has a central office costing approximately three million dollars a year[1] --- the equivalent of approximately 60 average-sized NSERC Discovery grants at a time when funding council budgets are frozen --- with little direct benefit to researchers. This sizeable central office drives all decision making in the federation at significant remove from interactions with the researchers, leading to poor, rigid, and expensive missteps such as the sorry and continuing saga of the multi-year "emergency" procurement of storage.

But as federated nonprofits everywhere know[2], and we should certainly deeply understand in Canada, attempts at control from headquarters, no matter how rigidly enforced the mandates and how expensively funded the central office, simply can’t effectively deploy the efforts of a decentralized federation of organizations to their shared mission, and certainly can’t efficiently unlock the differing strengths and existing capabilities of the federal colleagues.

Thus even with the current level of attempted central decision-making, there still is very not enough meaningful team-work between institutions, despite the endless hours on videoconferences; and Ph.D.-level computational scientists, rather than being research partners in projects suited to their expertise regardless of their location across the country, spend too much of their time answering help-desk-level questions about compiler errors and file system issues from users who happen to use the same computer that they sit beside. Lacking both the efficiency that comes from centralization and the flexibility that comes from decentralization, the community currently has the worst of both extremes.

A better future is possible, but the necessary changes will not just happen on their own. It is not within the power or ability of CFI to step in and impose a new vision of what a Canadian computational research support enterprise will be. Nor will the ministry insert itself into the operations of a scientific support organization; if it did, dozens of similar organizations across the country would rightly be up in arms.

So if the situation is to be fixed, it is up to us — the members, the regions, and the researchers — to do so. The members and regions together do have the power, and the duty to researchers, to reorganize Compute Canada and rebuild a more responsive national platform for computational research support.

But we can’t begin to fix our shared national computational research support enterprise without first choosing what "fixed" looks like. An inwards-focused Operational Plan exercise was promised after the externally-focused strategic planning process in 2014; this never happened. As a result, difficult but critically important internal questions were not debated and never received consensus answers --- How do we know what services researchers need? How do we best provide them? What is the role of a central organization? What is the role of the regions? How do decisions get made?

This document is one proposed set of answers to these questions; a sketch of one possible alternate future for providing computational research support in Canada. Its intention is to spur debate and inspire other different sets of answers, starting a discussion that should have happened three years ago. When a consensus emerges within our community, we will have both the knowledge of where we want to go, and the power to get there. Canadian research needs computing and data, and Canadian research deserves better than the current situation for providing them.
