Conclusion and Next Steps 
=========================

The purpose of this document is not to advocate in particular for the
proposals contained within (although the proposals made here reflect
genuinely-held convictions, rather than being straw-man arguments). The
purpose is to start in earnest a conversation that is overdue, allowing
the community to come to a consensus about what the internal
organizational structure of Compute Canada should be, how it should make
decisions, and how it should offer services to Canadian researchers and
scholars.

The most important next step, then, is for you to have this discussion
with colleagues locally and across the country, disagreeing vehemently
initially on some points, and coming to agreement on others. Our
document focuses on the organization that is Compute Canada. However, as
mentioned the principles and proposals presented can be applied to any
digital infrastructure organization. Furthermore, the ultimate
organization or governance structure that supports the delivery of
research computing support could be any number of a wide range of
models. Open discussions about that model, or various options could be a
valuable step forward. However, we advocate that regardless of the model
it is critical that researcher needs be the first and most important
consideration.

The members and regions can build a successful and coherent national
platform that works the way the community wants it to, but they cannot
do so before the community tells them what destination they should aim
for. The Canadian research and research computing communities can do
great things together. Letâ€™s get started.
