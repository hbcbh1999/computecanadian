Principles 
==========

We propose the following seven principles to guide our discussion of
what our national platform could be.

| **Principle**                | **Description**                                                                                                                     |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Researcher-Centred           | The driver for every decision is researcher needs, with technology a means to an end.                                               |
| Service Oriented             | The organization aims to enable research in a number of well-defined ways.                                                          |
| National                     | The platform aims to support researchers as best possible, regardless of where the researchers or the resources are.                |
| Equal Partners in Federation | Multiple funding partners, provinces, institutions, and the national office share different but equally important responsibilities. |
| Interoperable, not Identical | All parts of the natural platform must interoperate seamlessly, but they need not and should not be identical.                      |
| Collaborative                | All parties that support the platform are coming to the table in good faith to achieve a common goal.                               |
| Modern                       | Tools are offered where they improve the services and support for researchers.                                                      |

Researcher-Centred 
------------------

**Proposal: Research, and concrete researcher needs, should be the basis
for all decision making.**

All established organizations face the danger of losing the perspective
of those it serves. It becomes a little too natural to make decisions
based on what is easiest or best internally; this is especially true if
decisions are made several levels removed from those working directly
with the clients. Organizations that solve problems using technology are
doubly prone to this, as the technology begins to seem important for its
own sake, rather than simply being a way to help a client achieve
success. Note that in the Prologue, everything is arranged around
success for the researcher.

The difference between an organization that is focussed on its clients
and one whose focus is internal is reflected in behaviour, in particular
where time and money is spent. In a researcher-focussed technical
organization, the first question is always “how does this help the
researchers”; it casts decision making in terms of researcher needs and
successes rather than technical implementation details, deferring such
details until the last possible minute, and pushing such decisions as
close to the researchers as possible. Significant decisions can always
be justified in terms of making it easier for specific researchers to
tackle concrete current or proposed projects, and the amount of
resources allocated to that decision are proportional to those goals.

A researcher-centred organization must also ensure that they work
closely with other partners, so that researcher needs requiring
cooperation between service providers are met.

| **Not Researcher Centred**                                                   | **Researcher Centred**                                                                               |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Users must fill out many elaborate forms                                     | Easy sign-up, renewals, resource allocations                                                         |
| Technology drives decision-making                                            | Researcher goals drive decision-making                                                               |
| RFPs specify technical architecture, such as interconnects, feeds and speeds | RFPs specify job mixes, researcher-facing metrics                                                    |
| Projects and collaborations are launched for various reasons                 | Projects and collaborations undertaken to meet specific, concrete, researcher needs                  |
| The researchers adapt to the way things are done                             | The way things are done adapt to the researchers                                                     |
| Researchers cobble together services across digital infrastructure providers | Digital infrastructure providers work closely together to provide seamless services researchers need |

Service Oriented 
----------------

Keeping the researcher central to decision-making will not automatically
ensure that one is offering the most valuable services possible;
researchers will not necessarily know to ask for services that have not
been routinely provided in the past. One must constantly try new
offerings, but in a disciplined and researcher-centred way.

**Proposal: A broad range of research-support services should be
offered, with new services continually piloted.**

New services can be routinely and inexpensively trialled with pilot
projects, whether they centre on providing expertise, hardware,
software, or a combination. The training efforts, currently led by the
regions, demonstrates the advantage of this approach. Enrollment
provides immediate feedback on demand and content allowing for nimble
program development.

| **Not Service Oriented**                                                              | **Service Oriented**                                                               |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New services are chosen centrally and rolled out on a full scale nationally           | New services are piloted, tested, and scaled-up or phased out                      |
| Services tend to be low-level with limited value-add                                  | Services range from hardware-provision to research partnership                     |
| Services are either devised centrally, or done “the way things have always been done” | Best practices and new services used successfully elsewhere are routinely trialled |

In a technology-focussed research computing organization, the main
research computing service offered tends to be helpdesk-style questions
about logging in, compiler errors, or queuing jobs. Compute Canada
currently has approximately 60 Ph.D.-level staff and 30 with other
advanced degrees; it is critical that the federation makes as much use
of this skill and expertise to provide researchers the most important
added support, and retains these experts by providing meaningful
opportunities to contribute to research.

**Proposal: Services offered elsewhere, such as having staff participate
more closely in research, should be investigated.**

We can look to a variety of international organizations for examples of
successful service offerings. Examples include XSEDE’s extended
collaborative support services[^1], and the growing number of Research
Software Engineers[^2] in the UK. Such staff participate in the
research, often to the level of authorship, and manifestly enable
research that would have happened more slowly or not at all. In the 2013
Compute Canada survey of institutional and regional staff, this level of
participation was mentioned often as a desire technical experts. In the
Prologue, staff play several well-defined roles in Shannon’s project.

SHARCNET has long offered dedicated programmer time, one type of such
services, and it has been quite successful and indeed very popular with
both researchers and staff. Such efforts have not yet been trialled
nationally.

National 
--------

Any conversation about Compute Canada must have as a starting point that
Canadian researchers merit having access to a national portfolio of
resources, and that their location in the country cannot matter for the
type and level of services received.

**Proposal: The platform must be available to the entire Canadian
research community, with specific efforts to efficiently assemble the
most appropriate resources to support new and existing communities.**

Truly national provision of resources to researchers, particularly
resources as diverse and important as expertise, is something which
takes active effort on the part of the research support organization; it
can’t be neglected as something which is allowed in principle but left
to the researcher to pursue on their own. Presenting researchers with a
list of national staff and bullet lists of their expertise, and leaving
the researcher to try contacting staff members in turn to recruit them
to collaborate in their project, is a woefully inadequate approach to
enabling computational research projects. In the Prologue, national and
diverse resources are actively assembled to enable Shannon’s research.

| **Not Truly National**                                                                          | **Truly National**                                                                                        |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Researchers are given a list of national resources available for them to investigate themselves | National teams of resources are actively assembled for a project                                          |
| Researchers in some fields or institution types are overlooked                                  | Researchers are supported equally across the country, across all institution types                        |
| Services are replicated many times for provision to local users                                 | Providers are encouraged to specialize to meet local priorities and needs while providing services to all |

A truly national organization must ensure that Canadian researchers in
all fields and institution types are adequately supported. Researchers
in biological and life sciences (particularly human health), social
sciences, and scholars in the digital humanities must be served as
capably as those in physics and biochemistry; effort must be taken to
reach out to applied research work in colleges and polytechnics (over
\$200M/yr of external funding, approximately 40% of which comes from the
private sector).

Currently, computing resources for the very largest users of resources
are provisioned truly nationally, via the RAC process.

Equal Federated Partners 
------------------------

Canada has one of the most fiscally decentralized governments in the
G20. This flexibility has real benefits, but it introduces complexities
that are just as real, and is why there are no ready-made organizational
models for research support from abroad for us to copy for our national
project.

**Proposal: The structure of our federation partnership must reflect the
reality of several funding partners.**

The majority of funding for Compute Canada is driven by the provinces
and institutions with only 40% coming from national sources. The
provinces will reasonably have different priorities than the national
government, and their priorities and existing capabilities will differ
amongst themselves. Any organizational structure or process that doesn’t
acknowledge and accommodate these perfectly valid and healthy tensions
between equal funding partners will be too brittle to last.

| **Unequal Federal Partners**                                                                                        | **Equal Federal Partners**                                                                                                                        |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Central office makes all decisions                                                                                  | Central and provincial partners make decisions by consensus                                                                                       |
| Federal government gives money to provinces to spend however they want                                              | Investments are made to build a country-wide platform that supports all researchers, with regional contributions that reflect regional priorities |
| Understanding of researcher needs limited to either “the researchers we’ve worked with” or “researchers in general” | Researcher needs local and national, supported and not-yet-supported, are considered                                                              |

The crass-but-practical concern of funding is an immediately clear
justification for this principle, but not the most important. Being
researcher-centred means taking all perspectives on researcher needs
into account, and the partners in federation have important but
different perspectives.

As the front-line service-providers to researchers, the regions have
immediate and hands-on experience knowing what the investigators they
are working with need. The central office, communicating directly with
national societies and funding agencies, and conducting needs
assessments, knows what researchers collectively need, and what is
currently lacking in the research ecosystem.

An effort to be researcher-centred based on only one of those
perspectives cannot succeed. A project undertaken with a general intent
to support researchers in the abstract can only end badly. And a project
undertaken to help those researchers that are already being helped, but
more so, will leave an ever-larger number of investigators behind.

Incorporating both perspectives equally is genuinely difficult. As
Canadians have known for 150 years, decision-making by consensus between
federal and provincial bodies can be a slow and occasionally frustrating
process; but the results are robust and durable, and are better
decisions for having had the multiple inputs. A platform that values the
inherently federated nature of our partnership, and interoperability
rather than uniformity, can build on the strengths and priorities of its
participants rather than trying to paper them over.

Interoperable, not Identical 
----------------------------

The internet is arguably the most important computational tool for
enabling faster and better research made in modern times, and yet the
central internet body, the IETF, does not specify brands of computer and
browser, nor enforce a list of services that every website must provide
each user. Instead, strict interoperability requirements, coupled with
the freedom to innovate within those standards, have combined to make
the internet such a powerful research tool.

**Proposal: The services offered by the national platform must be
interoperable, not merely identical.**

The Canadian research environment can be strengthened by ensuring that
each project has the potential to access the complete national portfolio
of computational science resources. But to focus on implementation
details rather than interoperability standards is to miss out on many of
the opportunities that come from that working together and pooling
resources. In the Prologue, Shannon interacts with several hardware
systems and people in varying regions, so that interoperability is
vital; implementation details are not. Currently some of the national
teams, such as the security team, work under this model, defining
standards and best practices without specifying implementation details.

Focusing on interoperability rather than implementations allows
specialization, with different providers providing solutions tailored to
different use-cases; it allows experimentation, testing out new
implementations at one site without disrupting the platform as a whole;
it allows rapid prototyping and piloting of new approaches without
having to roll out homogeneous and potentially untested changes to the
entire country.

| **Focused on Identical**                                                                             | **Focused on Interoperable**                                                                     |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure is specified in terms of technical specifications                                     | Infrastructure requirements specified in terms of SLAs and interfaces to other infrastructure    |
| Experimentation requires lock-step changes across the country                                        | Experimentation can be performed easily and locally                                              |
| New sites cannot fully join the platform without wholesale replacement of infrastructure, procedures | New sites can easily fully join the platform by exposing services, infrastructure via interfaces |
| Little thought given to interaction with other digital infrastructure providers                      | Close collaboration and interoperation with other digital infrastructure providers               |

Well-defined interoperability requirements also makes bringing new
providers into the platform easier. As opposed to requiring a new site,
already providing services, to completely change how they operate, clear
expectations and interoperability requirements enable the site to fully
participate by exposing their existing services and infrastructure
through clear additional interfaces and standards. Similarly, focus on
interoperability promotes collaborating with other digital research
infrastructure providers.

Collaborative 
-------------

The foundation for any successful truly federated organization must be
collaboration, not merely co-existence. A federation, which incorporates
the breadth and diversity of researchers, provinces, funders and
personalities can only function if all parties come to the table in good
faith to discuss and negotiate. It can only be a success if the whole
becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

| **Not Collaborative**                            | **Collaborative**                                                     |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The focus is only on problems and challenges     | The focus is on solutions and opportunities                           |
| Parties are focused on their local organizations | Parties are focused on the shared mission of meeting researcher needs |
| Parties are not willing to compromise            | Parties are willing to give and take to achieve the shared mission    |
| Coexisting silos                                 | Whole greater than sum of its parts                                   |

This document outlines principles for a successful federated Compute
Canada, and one possible path to get there, but nothing is possible
without all parties wanting success and wanting to collaborate.

**Proposal: The federation should aim to achieve more than the partners
could achieve separately.**

Collaboration is not easy, and it often comes at the cost of taking more
time and energy. Working together, building consensus and getting people
onside requires time and compromise. And the only way this is possible
is if people are truly committed to success as a federation.

Collaboration cannot end at organizational borders. As very large-scale
research data and multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary consortia
become more and more important, close collaboration between and not just
within research support organizations will be vital. In the Prologue,
Shannon makes use of tools requiring compute, research data management,
and high performance networking.

Modern 
------

A research service organization which uses technology to address
researcher needs must stay on top of new tools so that they can fully
meet those needs. Although researcher needs must always be the driver,
solutions change quickly, so the service organization must be building
experience to evaluate the benefits of these technologies if deployed on
a larger scale.

New tools can include hardware — NVMe, FPGAs, and server-class ARM CPUs
are all technologies which could have significant impact on research
computing in the quite-near future — but they can also be new techniques
for robustly and efficiently providing technical services.

**Proposal: New training should continually be available for emerging
hardware and operational tools.**

An organization which embraces having modern tools must ensure there is
adequate staff time and training to learn and explore new hardware.
Small experimental systems must be made available to staff (and
interested researchers) to explore the suitability of new hardware for
research systems. Canada’s early but cautious and measured adoption of
GPUs took this approach successfully. And such an organization ought not
hesitate to make use of commercial cloud providers when appropriate to
make such new technologies available.

| **Not Embracing Modern Tools**                                                                               | **Embracing Modern Tools**                                                                                                           |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Limited or no availability of experimental systems                                                           | Ongoing investments in new technology for staff to explore for suitability for researcher use                                        |
| Little paid staff training                                                                                   | Provides staff with time and training in new methods and techniques                                                                  |
| Focus on ’tried-and-true’ methods from supercomputing centres for running systems and interacting with users | Focus on exploring, customizing, and using approaches from across large-scale computing for running systems, interacting with users. |
| Limited or no ongoing investigation of commercial service (*i.e.*, cloud): providers are the competition     | Commercial service providers are one of many options for providing services to researchers                                           |

A modern organization also experiments with and trains on new
operational tools. As more and more companies rely on computer
infrastructure, the past decade and a half have led to improved
approaches to ensuring the services they provide are reliable and
effective. Techniques like Google’s now-widely adopted SRE approach[^3]
or Netflix’s ‘Chaos Monkey’ emphasize automation, rigorous testing, and
continuous improvement, allow staff to focus on providing higher quality
services.

**Proposal: The federation should make use of best available tools for
interacting with and supporting researchers.**

Since interactions with the researcher are so important, a modern
research support organization also takes advantage of new tools from
elsewhere for working with clients. Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) packages enable the following of researcher interactions and
project progress, allowing staff anywhere in Canada to come up to speed
and assist a remote researcher. In the Prologue, Shannon benefits from
up-to-date hardware, system methodologies, and interaction tools.
