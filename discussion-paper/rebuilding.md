Rebuilding To Our Principles
============================

Having laid out a set of guiding principles, one can begin to design a new national organizational structure that adheres to them, aligning better to the expectations of the community.

The Players
-----------

The main building blocks of our national project include a national office; the provincial or regional organizations (henceforth, the regions), which we take to include the sites and the institutions that host them.[10] The two have different relative strengths.

The regional organizations are responsible for directly providing almost all services, both expertise and hardware-based, to researchers. They work with both local researchers in their region, and remotely with researchers across the country. They have hands-on experience with what the researchers they are working with need, and the knowledge as to how to meet those needs. The regions have a strong understanding of the needs and priorities of provincial and institutional partners.

The national office has the birds-eye view of the national research community. This different perspective matters; our mandate is not just to assist individual researchers already working with us but Canadian researchers collectively. It is far too easy to focus too much on either the forest or the trees, and the combination of hands-on and birds-eye perspectives is vital in setting priorities, and in identifying pockets of Canadian research we are currently letting down. The national office also has more natural working relationships with national partners like the funding agencies and national societies, technical collaborators like CANARIE, or potential international partners like XSEDE or PRACE.

The Federation
--------------

The regional organizations and national office together make up our federation, our national platform of services we provide to researchers.

This paragraph shouldn’t have to be written, but the confusion on this point seems almost total in some quarters, so: The national office is not the federation. The board of the national office is not the board of the federation; the CEO of the national office is not the CEO of the federation. As *primus inter pares* of the colleagues that make up our national project, the national office plays vital agenda-setting, prioritizing, and tie-breaking roles; but like each of the regions, it is a provider of services to the federation, and it is judged on how well it provides them.

The confusion between Compute-Canada-the-national-office and Compute-Canada-the-national-project has taken such hold that creating a new name for the national project in its own right is recommended. This author is bad at naming things, so no suggestions are offered, but whether one calls it an alliance, a coalition, a federation, a partnership, or a network[11], for the time being being clear about which one of the two one is speaking about will require use of a different name.

Running a federated organization together is genuinely difficult, but it is quite common for non-profits, and there is an extensive literature and many reports on how to do it well. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many particularly good works that discuss approaches to take and pitfalls to avoid are written in the Canadian context: “A Framework for Success for Nonprofit Federations Revised”[12], “Local Business Structures within a Federated Model”[13], and “The Characteristics of a Federated Network of Financial Cooperatives”[14] and references therein are particularly recommended.

Roles in a Rebooted Compute Canada
----------------------------------

With this clarified picture of the relationships between the players, one can begin to sketch out a new model which would better reflect the principles discussed above.

### Role of the National Office and Regions

As the first amongst equals and as the only body with a national view, it is the national office’s responsibility to set the agenda and to drive national needs assessments. It is also the responsibility of the national office to ensure that clear interoperability standards and interfaces are defined for services, and to hold providers accountable for meeting those standards. The national office might also be responsible for simple technical services to the platform itself, like a next-generation CCDB or a CRM/ticketing system, if that is a sensible choice.

The regions are responsible for providing research-support services to the federation meeting the agreed-upon standards, and must be free to do so however they see fit. They must hold the national office accountable for meeting its responsibilities, and must play a role in holding each other accountable for their contributions to the platform as well. They will generally be the parties proposing and testing new services.

An important service-provision distinction to make is that the regions provide services both to the national platform, and to their respective province(s) and institutions. Those relationships, and that form of service provision, is out-of-scope for the federation. The federation must hold regions (and the national office) accountable for meeting their responsibilities to the platform; but every region will negotiate its relationship and duties to its province(s) and institutions differently, and the national office or other regions stepping into those discussions is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Decision Making by Consensus

Decision making in the federation must almost exclusively be done by consensus, with the national office reluctantly breaking ties if such consensus cannot be reached — realizing that repeated lack of consensus is toxic to the working relationship of the collaborators in the federation.

This isn’t merely a philosophical or aesthetic point of view about how federations should work; this is vital for performing one of the most fundamental functions of the federation, the incorporation of multiple points of view — in particular, the hands-on and birds-eye views. We cannot be researcher-centred if we are not including both the experiences of working with some individual researchers and the assessed needs of the community as a whole. If there is one point on which the organizational literature on federated non-profits are uniformly agreed on, it is the importance of the consensus approach; the second would be the challenge of doing so. If there are topics or services which are repeatedly difficult to find consensus on, one must seriously consider the possibility that they should not be part of the federations efforts at that time.

### Service-based Budgeting

Although almost every step of the process was almost comically mishandled, the basic model of the system acquisition procurements in progress currently, essentially a services-based approach, is a reasonable approach for much new spending, even if disfigured into a caricature of itself:

1.  <span>Identify a priority for the national platform, and define as a service that is offered to the platform with associated SLAs and interfaces — by consensus, with the national office as a tie-breaker,</span>

2.  <span>Have the federation colleagues propose taking on responsibility for providing some or all the needed service (hardware, expertise, or combination), allowing regions to build on existing strengths or meet regional priorities,</span>

3.  <span>Assign the service, with its standards and defined interfaces, to one of the proposers — preferably by consensus, but for big ticket items where this is unlikely to be possible, by some pre-agreed-upon process led by the national office,</span>

4.  <span>Once the agreement is made, the provider is free to implement the service in any way they see fit, but are held accountable for meeting the agreed-upon standards.</span>

This is just as tractable a model for expertise-based services as it is for hardware-based services. For systems staff, this is fairly intuitive. Clearly, the level of staffing required for hands-on work in providing particular hardware services would be part of any sensible setup for proposing and evaluating hardware services. For analysts, the services of an analyst with expertise in oceanography, or a performance-tuning specialist, can be made available to the platform in the same way.

Note a clarifying aspect of casting analyst services in this model. There is a long-running discussion about whether it is best to have fewer, larger centres with more expertise in one place, or more distributed support, with staff located in many institutions to provide hands-on availability to more investigators and institutions. But weighing this trade-off is out-of-scope for the federation. Locality-as-a-service is beyond the power of a national platform to provide. Locally, some provinces and institutions will value having staff distributed widely more highly; some will prefer the centre-based approach. The internal preferences of the regions are their own concern.

While this approach works with new spending, it doesn’t automatically help with the current and urgent questions surrounding the operating budget. The process of creating a service catalog and inventory was started some years ago, and was abandoned; had it been seen through to completion, the infrastructure for making the operating budget much clearer and more transparent might be available today. Unfortunately, the current mess was years in the making, and while a new model may help provide focus over time, refactoring our platform into a more manageable federation structure will take substantial effort.

### Formal Descriptions of the Relationship

While the above describe useful overall principles of new relationships in our national platform, actually making it work will hinge on the details. While our community is full of expertise in the sciences and in technology, laying down sturdy and useable rules-of-the-road for the new Compute Canada will require experience and hands-on knowledge we don’t possess.

Luckilly, there are many individuals and agencies in Canada which have helped create new federal structures for nonprofits, or re-negotate broken ones; we will require their help. A new “constitution” will have to be negotated between all federal colleagues, with clear and specific responsibilites for each, mechanisms for accountability, and processes for decision making laid out.

As with playing a new board game for the first time, these rule books will be constantly flipped through initially, and then less and less often, and eventually they will be seldom-used, with updates and house rules scribbled in the margins. But a close working relationship of colleagues requires extremely high levels of trust and mutual respect; those having been depleted long since, we will have to substitute the rule books in the near future.

However, the rule books won’t be enough; it is hard to stay motivated to play a game with someone who has long played it very differently. It is hard to see how the new federation can be made to work without some players leaving the game, leaving room at the table for those who are committed to the new rules.

[11] The author is quite fond of the underused word “syndicate”, which is probably enough to disqualify it immediately.
