\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {1.5}The structure of our federation partnership must reflect the reality of several funding partners. }{7}{proposal.1.5}
\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {1.6}The services offered by the national platform must be interoperable, not merely identical.}{8}{proposal.1.6}
\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {1.7}The federation should aim to achieve more than the partners could achieve separately.}{9}{proposal.1.7}

\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {2.5}Federation-wide decision making processes should be supported by all members of the federation.}{14}{proposal.2.5}
\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {2.6}The federation should make it clear internally, to the research community, and to funders, the value of the federation, the delineation of roles, and the services provided by the federation.}{15}{proposal.2.6}

\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {3.1}Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should reflect our Principles.}{16}{proposal.3.1}
\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {3.2}Services provided should come with agreed-upon SLAs ensuring quality and interoperability. }{16}{proposal.3.2}
\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {3.3}Services should be piloted, with definitions of success decided upon before the pilot. }{16}{proposal.3.3}
\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {3.4}The central office should be responsible for nation-wide needs assessments and researcher satisfaction. }{17}{proposal.3.4}
\contentsline {proposal}{\numberline {3.5}The agenda should be managed by the central office, and consensus should be found or built around priorities. }{17}{proposal.3.5}
